   <Name>Specify marshaling for P/Invoke string arguments</Name>
   <Description>When marshaling strings as ANSI (or as Auto on Win9x), some characters may be changed. If best-fit mapping is on, strings that appear different in Unicode will be marshaled to identical ANSI strings, which may lead to incorrect security decisions. Turning best-fit mapping off reduces this risk, as all characters without equivalents are mapped to '?'. Also, note that CharSet.Ansi is the default setting for all string marshaling; Unicode marshaling must be specified explicitly, either as a CharSet setting of DllImport or StructLayout, or as a MarshalAs attribute with a Unicode (or system-dependent) UnmanagedType.</Description>
   <Resolution Name="ParameterImplicitAnsi">To reduce security risk, marshal parameter {0} as Unicode, by setting DllImport.CharSet to CharSet.Unicode, or by explicitly marshaling the parameter as UnmanagedType.LPWStr. If you need to marshal this string as ANSI or system-dependent, specify MarshalAs explicitly, and set BestFitMapping=false; for added security, also set ThrowOnUnmappableChar=true.</Resolution>
